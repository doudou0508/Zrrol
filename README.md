Gekko is *going to be* a Bitcoin trading bot for [Mt. Gox](http://mtgox.com) written in node, it will feature multiple trading methods using technical analysis.

## What?

This project is a learning excercise of me, a student with *some* experience in programming (mostly web) and zero experience in economics and trading. I figured writing my own trade bot would be the best way to learn about implementing mathematical trading algorithms. So here is **my very first attempt at anything related to trading / algorithmic decision making**.

I'm developing Gekko fully open source in the hope of getting feedback from folks with more experience in this field. Because I not only want to attract programmers I am doing my best to make the code as readable as possible, this includes a lot of comments and probably not the most efficient (but expressive) code.

As this is a learning experience for me all feedback is extremely appreciated. If you don't want to contribute to the code you can always just send me an [email](mailto:mike@mvr.me).

*USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!*

## How do I install it?

*Gekko is currently not at a working stage yet.*

Gekko runs on [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/), the easiest way to install it is using [npm](http://npmjs.org). When you got both of those you can run this command in your terminal to fetch all of Gekko's files:

    npm install gekko
